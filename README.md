# Simple Paginator
This simple paginator was built to allow for easily paginating through arrays that may be client side. Usually these 
types of things take place when the data is being sourced from either a database or API but on the odd occasion, it 
could arise that you already have too much data client side. This paginator provides a simple interface to manipulate
these arrays.

This paginator was built specifically with TypeScript in mind.
